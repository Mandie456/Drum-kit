# 🥁 Drum-kit

Hi there! This is a simple drum kit project I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each button on the screen has its own drum sound, and you can also press the keys on your keyboard to play them. I added images behind each button to make it more fun and realistic.

## 🎵 How it works
- Press any of these keys: `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`
- Or just click the buttons on the screen
- Each one plays a different sound like crash, kick, snare, and toms

## 💡 What I learned
This project helped me understand:
- How to use event listeners in JavaScript
- How to play audio in the browser
- How to work with the DOM and add some cool styles with CSS

## 🛠️ How to run it
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start drumming!

Thanks for checking out my project 😊
